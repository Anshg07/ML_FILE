Originally a part of the vast landholding called the Manor or Patroonship of Rensselaerswyck, the Crailo farm was named after the Van Rensselaer's estate in the Netherlands, variously spelled Crayloo or Cralo in the 17th century, and meaning ""crows' wood"" in Dutch.Crailo was built in the early 18th century by Hendrick Van Rensselaer, grandson of the First Patroon. Hendrick died in 1740 and his eldest son, Johannes, inherited Crailo. He remodeled the house and added an east wing in the Georgian style, reflecting the increasing influence of the English on the Albany-area Dutch.In the late 18th century, Crailo was remodeled in the Federal style. It served as a boys' boarding school in the 1840s and later as a church rectory. Each new venture brought more changes to the structure. In 1924 Crailo was donated to New York State for development as a museum.Crailo today tells the story of the early Dutch inhabitants of the upper Hudson Valley through exhibits highlighting archeological finds from the Albany Fort Orange excavations, special programs, and guided tours of the museum.Outreach programs to schools and hearthside cooking programs are available by reservation.Congratulations Crailo, WINNER of the 2010 CINE Special Jury Award for the film:""Keeping Order: A Fort Orange Court Record""",Visitor Center

Long before the American Revolution these colonial powers both laid claim to the Champlain Valley and this strategically important peninsula known as Crown Point. The French built Fort St. Frederic here between 1734 and 1737 and used it as a base for raids on British settlements in New York and New England. As a result, the British mounted various expeditions to take control of Crown Point, and in 1759 they were finally successful. They immediately began construction of new fortifications that they called ""His Majesty's Fort of Crown Point"". Enclosing over seven acres this was one of the largest built by the British in North America.In 1775, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the American colonists captured the fort and secured sorely needed cannons and heavy ordnance. Crown Point was occupied by General John Burgoyne's army in 1777 after the American evacuation to Mount Independence and remained under British control until the end of the war. The ruins of Fort St. Frederic, ""His Majesty's Fort of Crown Point,"" and surrounding lands were acquired by the State of New York in 1910.Today, visitors can explore the preserved ruins of these forts and tour the museum which includes a multimedia orientation program, large scale models, and an exhibit of original artifacts recovered from the site by archaeologists. Additionally, the site offers access to the historic Crown Point Pier, the Champlain Memorial Lighthouse, the walking paths on either side of the newly constructed Lake Champlain Bridge, and fantastic views of Lake Champlain.

Construction of his residence on the colonial frontier was completed around 1764. General Herkimer's place in history was assured in 1777 when he assembled 800 militiamen, supported by 60 allied Oneida warriors, and marched to defend Ft. Stanwix against a British siege. Considered to be a significant turning point in the Revolutionary War, the Battle of Oriskany, fought on August 6, 1777, has been described as one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Although wounded in the leg, Herkimer kept command during the fierce combat. After the battle he was carried home where he died 10 days later from complications following the amputation of his leg. Herkimer's estate was home to many over the years, including his family, enslaved people who helped run the estate, soldiers encamped during the war, and neighbors seeking refuge from the fighting in the Mohawk Valley.

Many Americans know the song ""John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,"" but most do not associate the words with this simple farm at North Elba, New York.On the night of October 16, 1859, Brown and his followers assaulted the U.S. Arsenal at Harper's Ferry, planning to use the captured arms in an extensive campaign for the liberation of the slaves in the South. Brown was captured on October 18, 1859, imprisoned at Charlestown, Virginia, tried by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and hanged on December 2, 1859. His body was returned to North Elba and was buried in front of his home on December 8, 1859. The remains of several of Brown's followers, who fought and died at Harper's Ferry, were moved to this small graveyard in 1899.Brown's final prophesy--""I, John Brown, am quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.

All that I ever had -- may it be yours by stretching forth your hand and taking it."" And so echo the words of John Burroughs, one of the country's great nature writers. The last resting place of this famous literary naturalist overlooks a quiet field surrounded by magnificent views of the Catskill Mountains where he made his home and was first inspired by the unspoiled beauties of the woods, fields, and mountains.John Burroughs, the celebrated naturalist whose 27 books of nature and philosophical essays influenced millions of readers, was born April 3, 1837 on the family's homestead in Roxbury, Delaware County, NY. There he learned the rhythms of nature and the connections between all living things, lessons that shaped his career as a literary naturalist.Much of his adult life was spent on a small farm overlooking the Hudson River in West Park, Ulster County where he grew grapes, and celery while perfecting the art of the nature essay. His work appeared in Harper's, Scribner's, Atlantic Monthly and other magazines of the day, opening the eyes of his 19th- and 20th-century contemporaries to the wonders of the natural world right outside their doors.His essays were collected in books that sold more than a million and a half copies in his lifetime and were required reading in schools across the country. He became a respected friend of such luminaries as novelist Hamlin Garland and Ida Tarbell, industrialists Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison; and political leaders including Teddy Roosevelt, who wrote of Burroughs, ""It is a good thing for our people that you should have lived.""In 1899 he served as the historian on the Harriman Expedition exploring the coast of Alaska with conservationist John Muir, painter Louis Agassiz, photographer Edward Curtis and a host of scientists.But always his heart remained in the Catskills. ""Those hills comfort me as no other place in the world,"" he wrote. And so, in 1910, Burroughs returned to the comfort of the family farm to spend summers in a little farmhouse he named Woodchuck Lodge. There he continued to write in a hay barn up the road, and there he entertained neighbors and luminaries alike.While he was not a strict conservationist or an environmental activist, his message of land stewardship and his quiet warnings about the potential impact of unchecked development and resource consumption resonate today.John Burroughs died March 29, 1921. He was buried on his 84th birthday in what is now Burroughs Memorial Field, a state historic site just up the road from Woodchuck Lodge and within a mile of the farmstead where he was raised.Woodchuck Lodge, is open for tours the first weekend of each month, May through October, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Memorial Field, where an outdoor exhibit offers photos and information about the life and work of John Burroughs, is open to visitors during daylight hours daily.Mailing Addressc/o Mine Kill State ParkPO Box 923, Route 30North Blenheim, NY 12131","Picnic Area, Tours"

Johnson was the largest single landowner and most influential individual in the colonial Mohawk Valley. His success in dealing with the Six Nations of the Iroquois greatly influenced England's victory over France for control of colonial North America. For his service, the British Crown bestowed upon Johnson the title of Baronet, and later appointed him Superintendent of Indian Affairs, a position to which he devoted himself and held throughout his life.Differing cultures, traditions and languages combined to create a unique life for the Johnson family, with the Hall bustling with activity as home life and business life intermingled daily. Visitors included members of various Indian tribes, sometimes numbering in the hundreds at Council gatherings. The home was the centerpiece of a 700-acre working estate, with gardens, a mill, blacksmith shop, Indian store, barns, slave and servant housing and other essential buildings.Following the death of Sir William in 1774, Molly and her children left Johnson Hall, and his eldest son John inherited the property and title of Baronet. The Revolution would cause this Loyalist family to eventually flee to Canada, and the Johnson Hall property and most of its contents were subsequently sold at auction following the War.

be a significant turning point in the Revolutionary War, the Battle of
Oriskany, fought on August 6, 1777, has been described as one of its bloodiest
battles.  While the British were
attacking Fort Stanwix in August 1777, Brigadier General Nicholas Herkimer
assembled 800 militiamen, supported by 60 allied Oneida warriors, and marched
from Fort Dayton to aid against the siege. Upon hearing of Herkimer's advance,
British and Loyalist troops under Sir John Johnson and Col. John Butler, and
Native American forces led by Mohawk Joseph Brant, ambushed the American troops
in a ravine west of Oriskany Creek. The patriots fought in brutal hand-to-hand combat,
and despite heavy losses, caused their opponents to retreat. General Herkimer
received a wound to his leg which led to his death ten days later.The Oneidas were the only Haudenosaunee nation to side with the
Americans and it is that famous battle that cemented their legacy as America's
First Allies.A monument was dedicated on August 6,
1884, to serve as a memorial to those who fought so bravely and tenaciously to
preserve freedom. Oriskany Battlefield was designated a New York State historic
site in 1927. In recognition of the site's exceptional historic value, the

Overlooking the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains, Staatsburgh is a fine example of a great estate built by America's financial and industrial leaders during the Gilded Age (1876 - 1917). Also known as the American Renaissance, this period in American history was marked by America's rapid economic growth and emergence as a world power. Darius Ogden Mills, father of Ogden Mills, established the family fortune by investing in banks, railroads and mines. Ogden Mills, like his father, was a noted financier and philanthropist. In 1882 he married Ruth Livingston, whose family had been prominent landowners in the Hudson Valley since the 17th century. In 1890, Ruth Livingston Mills inherited her childhood home and property which had once belonged to her great-grandfather, Morgan Lewis, the third governor of New York State.In the 1890s Mr. & Mrs. Mills commissioned the prestigious New York City architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White to remodel and enlarge their home. Work began in 1895 and when completed in 1896, the house had been transformed from a 25-room Greek Revival style home into a Beaux-Arts mansion of 65 rooms and 14 bathrooms. Although the interior was lavishly decorated, mostly in the styles of 17th and 18th-century France, many architectural features of the earlier Livingston home such as the all the trims, moldings and many of the fireplaces had been preserved. This melding of grandeur and heritage is characteristic of the American Renaissance period. Owning five homes, the Mills family resided in their Staatsburg home primarily in the fall and entertained as many as 80 guests at a time. The home and surrounding property was passed to their son, Ogden Livingston Mills in 1929.

In 1777, Steuben volunteered his services to Benjamin Franklin to advise the ill-trained American army. At Valley Forge, he converted the ragged, starving army into an effective fighting force. His program greatly increased the morale and strengthened the army. He authored the ""Blue Book,"" which still remains a basic reference for military training and organization.After the war, Congress granted von Steuben a life annuity and New York State deeded him a large parcel of land in appreciation for his wartime contributions. He summered on his land in a two-room log house until his death in November 1794. Although in his will he requested an unmarked grave, in 1804, his remains were transferred to what is now known as the ""Sacred Grove."" An 1870 monument marks Baron von Steuben's final resting place.NOTE:Steuben Memorial is managed in partnership with the National Park Service at Fort Stanwix National Monument.Mailing AddressNYS Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, 17 Rippleton RoadCazenovia, NY 13035",Tours

The Stonewall Inn National Monument sits across the street from The Stonewall Inn, a National Historic Landmark. The Stonewall Inn itself exists as a private establishment and working bar.  On June 24th 2016, The Stonewall Inn was designated a State Historic Site.Learn more.For more information visit:The Stonewall Inn National MonumentChristopher Park is open daily from approximately 9 am to dusk.History of the Stonewall InnThe events that began at the Stonewall Inn in June 1969 marked a monumental change for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Americans. Through much of American history LGBT citizens suffered from bigotry and widespread discrimination, affecting employment, housing, social life, and almost all facets of everyday life.  Even into the 1960s, most gays were closeted for fear of violent repercussions should their sexual orientation become known.In the late 1960s,  it was illegal in New York for bars to serve anyone known or suspected of being gay, and police regularly raided gay establishments. Nevertheless, despite repeated raids, bars such as the Stonewall Inn, on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, offered a respite where gays could meet and socialize with some degree of safety.On June 28, 1969, the police raided the Stonewall Inn. This time, however, bar patrons and a crowd outside resisted, chanting, throwing beer cans, pennies and other objects, until police were forced back into the bar.  Over the next few nights, additional confrontations occurred outside the Stonewall, in nearby Christopher Park, and on adjacent streets.This rebellion proved a major catalyst for self-awareness among LGBT Americans and precipitated decades of social change, leading to such reforms as marriage equality and the right of gays to serve openly in the military.The Stonewall Inn is an international symbol of the fight for equality for  LGBT Americans. In 1999, the Stonewall Inn and surrounding site was the first property in the United States listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its association with LGBT civil rights.Mailing Address26 Wall Street, Federal Hall National Monument c/o Stonewall National Monument New York , NY 10005",

This is where Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led his corps of Continental Light Infantry in a daring midnight attack on the British, seizing the site's fortifications and taking the soldiers and camp followers at the British garrison as prisoners on July 16, 1779.By May 1779 the war had been raging for four years and both sides were eager for a conclusion. Sir Henry Clinton, Commander-In-Chief of the British forces in America, attempted to coerce General George Washington into one decisive battle to control the Hudson River. As part of his strategy, Clinton fortified Stony Point. Washington devised a plan for Wayne to lead an attack on the garrison. Armed with bayonets only, the infantry captured the fort in short order, ending British control of the river.The Stony Point Lighthouse, built in 1826, is the oldest lighthouse on the Hudson River. De-commissioned in 1925, it now stands as a historical reminder of the importance of lighthouses to commerce on the Hudson River. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 unleashed a surge of commercial navigation along the Hudson River, by linking New York city to America's heartland. Within a year, the first of the Hudson's fourteen lights shone at Stony Point and others soon followed, designed to safely guide maritime travel along the river. Many light keepers, including several remarkable women such as Nancy and Melinda Rose at Stony Point, made their homes in the lighthouse complexes, and ensured that these important navigational signals never failed to shine.The site features a museum, which offers exhibits on the battle and the Stony Point Lighthouse, as well as interpretive programs, such as reenactments highlighting 18th century military life, cannon and musket firings, cooking demonstrations, and children's activities and blacksmith demonstrations.No Pets AllowedMailing AddressP.O.

The facilities at the camps, which are nestled in the woods next to the many lakes at Harriman State Park, consist of dining halls and recreation buildings, cabins and tent platforms, and waterfront facilities. Nature Centers offer environmental education programs designed to teach campers about the woods and instill in them a lifelong sense of wonder for the natural sciences.For generations, the group camps have provided children and families with their first outdoor experiences. The camps are operated by a wide variety of organizations, from outdoor recreation clubs to not-for profits servicing homeless children and the disabled, from the surrounding New York and New Jersey area.

Taylor and J. Neal Plum. William Nicoll, founder of the Town of Islip, originally built his estate on this property. The park was bought by the State of New York using a donation by the affluent August Heckscher with strong opposition from wealthy local residents. It was one of Robert Moses' most difficult fights to obtain land for public recreation on Long Island. Only with assistance and support from then Governor Alfred E. Smith was Moses able to close the deal on this beautiful property fronting the Great South Bay.The 1,600 acres of Heckscher State Park on the south shore of Long Island are used by park visitors for a number of outdoor activities; primarily, the park's shady picnic groves provide the idyllic spots for family and group picnic outings. Large open fields are used for soccer, cricket, lacrosse, and other field sports. Four miles of paved, multi-use trails attract bicycle riders, walkers, and nature lovers. In addition to stunning views of the Great South Bay with Fire Island as the backdrop, visitors see whitetail deer, a variety of birds and other wildlife.The Great South Bay is a great park resource, providing opportunities for bay swimming, boat launching, sail boarding, kayaking, and canoeing.

The Continental Army was engaged in battle with the British regulars, Loyalist rangers and 1000 Native American warriors. The battle of Newtown was the decisive clash in one of the largest offensive campaigns of the American Revolution. This expedition, known as the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign, had been regarded as punishment to several tribes among the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy who had sided with the British in the war and had attacked frontier settlements.A stone monument was dedicated at the top of the hill on August 29, 1879, the centennial of the Battle of Newtown. The present granite monument was erected in 1912.

This scenic course offers tee times for either 9 or 18 hole rounds of golf. The original course was built in 1893 and consisted of only 9 holes on the south side of the present course. At that time, Dinsmore was a private course enjoyed by the many prominent families living along the Hudson River. In 1952 the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation acquired the golf course and in the early 1960's created an additional 9 holes. These holes currently form the north side of the present course. Dinsmore Golf Course is also home to a full service restaurant and office. The office offers golf carts for rental and gift certificates for purchase.Staatsburgh State Historic Site, an elegant country house located atop a grassy hill overlooking the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains, is the centerpiece of Mills State Park.

After numerous proposals and an abandoned plan two years into its production, construction of an unprecedented magnitude began in 1837 under the expertise of John Bloomfield Jervis. The proposed plan called for a 41-mile aqueduct and dam to be built in order to run water from the Croton River to New York City. Three to four thousand workers, mostly Irish immigrants earning up to $1.00 per day, completed the masonry marvel in just five years. In 1842 water flowed into above-ground reservoirs located at the present sites of the New York Public Library and the Great Lawn of Central Park. Throngs of people attended the formal celebration held on October 14th and celebrated with ""Croton cocktails"" - a mix of Croton water and lemonade.This 19th-century architectural achievement cost New York City approximately 13 million dollars and was believed able to provide New Yorkers with fresh water for centuries to come. The population spiraled upward at a dizzying rate, however, and the Croton Aqueduct, which was capable of carrying 100 million gallons per day, could no longer meet New York City's needs by the early 1880s. Construction of the New Croton Aqueduct began in 1885 and water began to flow by 1890. Although no longer the sole supplier of fresh water, the Old Croton Aqueduct continued to provide water to New York City until 1965.In 1968, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation purchased 26.2 miles of the original 41-mile aqueduct from New York City. Presently, Old Croton Aqueduct State Historic Park is a linear park which runs from Van Cortlandt Park at the Bronx County/City of Yonkers border to the Croton Dam in Cortlandt. In 1987 a section was reopened to supply the Town of Ossining and in 1992 the Old Croton Aqueduct was awarded National Historic Landmark Status. The scenic path over the underground aqueduct winds through urban centers and small communities. It passes near numerous historic sites, preserves, a museum highlighting the construction of the Aqueduct, and many homes. The Aqueduct's grassy ceiling provides abundant recreational opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts. While primarily for walking and running, parts of the trail are suitable for horseback riding, biking (except during ""mud season""), bird watching, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing.Aqueduct Education ProjectDid you know?

Thirty miles north of New York City, the property is the former Pocantico Hills and Rockwood Hall country estates of John D. Rockefeller family and William Rockefeller. Since 1983, the Rockefeller Family has generously donated over 1771 acres to the State of New York to safeguard these lands for present and future generations. Managed by New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, the Preserve is open to the public year-round, sunrise to sunset.The trails of the Preserve are crushed stone carriage roads laid out by John D. Rockefeller Sr. and Jr. in the first half of the 20th century. Designed to complement the landscape, the 45 miles of scenic carriage roads are wide and easy to walk. Popular for walking, riding, jogging, and carriage driving, combinations of trails lead through varied landscapes and past natural and historical features, such as Swan Lake, the Pocantico River with its wood and stone bridges, gurgling streams, colonial stone walls and rock outcroppings. Trail maps of the carriage roads are available at the Preserve Office.The Preserve is primarily hardwood forest dominated by huge oak, tulip poplar, maple, and beech trees. The forests, fields, streams, and wetlands support a high diversity of native species of resident and migratory birds, mammals, insects, amphibians, reptiles, fish and aquatic species, some of which are in decline and now uncommon in Westchester County. With 202 recorded species of birds and its Important Bird Area designation by the National Audubon Society, the Preserve is a must-visit area for birders. Over 100 species of native wild bees frequent spring and summer wildflowers. In the fall, Monarch butterflies stop to feed and lay eggs during their southward migration. An on-going environmental stewardship is underway to favor native biological diversity.Rockwood Hall is a distinct bucolic section of the Preserve with commanding views of the Hudson River and Palisade Cliffs. Between 1886 and 1922, William Rockefeller's estate was 1000 acres with a 202-room mansion, a working farm, and a landscape designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, father of American landscape design. While the house and buildings are now gone, massive rock walls around the former house site and extensive grassy fields with magnificent specimen trees harken back to the heyday of the estate during the gilded age.While in the preserve, stop in the Preserve's Gallery by the entrance where rotating exhibits feature contemporary art and natural history exhibits. In the entrance courtyard between the Gallery and Preserve office is the Tree Peony Garden.Please Note:Bicycles, mechanized vehicles, drones, metal detectors, snowmobiling, camping, and open fires are strictly prohibited.

The Penn and Fountain landfills were operated by New York City Department of Sanitation from 1956 to 1983.After the landfills were closed, the work to reclaim and repurpose the 407 acres of land as a future park began. The first steps were to install an impermeable plastic cap and a below-ground barrier to fully encapsulate the landfills and support future reuse. A below grade methane gas piping system was also installed throughout the property so that all off gassing is carried to the property's two flares.More than 1.2 million cubic yards of clean soil - or enough to fill nearly 100,000 dump trucks - was spread up to four feet deep across the site. The site was then planted with more than 35,000 trees and shrubs, and native grassland species. This addition of prairie grass and native plants has created a diverse ecosystem of coastal meadows, wetlands, and woodlands that has attracted a variety of birds and other local wildlife. In addition, this lovely ecosystem works to protect the capped land and prevent erosion.In 1974, the city deeded the land to the National Park Service as part of Gateway National Recreation Area. Under a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service and the City of New York, New York State Parks is developing and operating Shirley Chisholm State Park.After years of anticipation, Shirley Chisholm State Park is now open 365 days per year, 8 a.m. to dusk.The park offers:10 miles of biking and hiking trails - please stay on the trails!SCSP Bike Library with loaner bikes for park patrons of all agesGorgeous waterfront access on Penn Pier, Hendrix Creek PatioPicnickingEnvironmental Education including fishing, guided bird walks and nature in your neighborhoodPlease help us take care of this wonderful park and respect the rules:Please place all trash and recycling in the proper containersPlease, no smoking!Please, no grilling or fires!Please leave your dogs and pets at homePlease keep wildlife wild, do not feed the birds or water fowlPets are not allowed at Shirley Chisholm State Park.Mailing Address950 Fountain Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11239","Fishing, Hiking"

Three lovely bridges stretch over Sunken Meadow Creek as it runs from the interior of the park to tidal flats at the mouth of the Nissequogue river. South of the flats are acres of undeveloped and heavily wooded rolling hills.Among the most popular picnic parks on Long Island, Sunken Meadow hosts millions of people each year partaking of family and group outings. Pick-up sports are enjoyed on the ball fields and several informal open lawn areas. Swimming here is truly family-oriented in the generally calm waters of the Sound. Many people enjoy the health benefits of measured walks along the Â¾ mile boardwalk. Cross country running events are held over the hilly running course. The park is the northern terminus of the Long Island Greenbelt trail for hiking.From Field 3 at the eastern portion of park, launching is available for windsurfing, kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding, and canoeing.27 holes of golf at Governor Alfred E. Smith Sunken Meadow State ParkGolf course architect Alfred H. Tull (1897-1982) designed what are today the Red and Green Courses in 1964. Tull, who designed the Yellow Course and redesigned the Blue Course at Bethpage State Park in the 1950s, was noted for laying out golf courses without consulting topographical maps. Only after his routing of the course was complete did he overlay his plan on topographical maps. The result seems to be golf courses which make maximum use of the existing terrain. In the case of Sunken Meadow State Park that terrain is somewhat hilly and variable, surrounded by mature woodlands; resulting in an attractive and relaxing outdoor experience for golfers. The view of the Long Island Sound from the golf driving range is stunning in its beauty.The use of motorized golf carts was introduced in 1997. Today, in the hierarchy of state park golf courses in the region, the Sunken Meadow courses are intended to serve golfers of a moderate skill level. While maintenance and operation of the golf facilities is kept at an excellent level, they are not maintained at championship level. The courses provide an enjoyable outing with moderate challenges, but not punishing for those who make errant shots.Find more aboutpark permit information.Pavilion InformationSunken Meadow has one pavilion.

The park provides access to the Hudson River's breathtaking landscape for pedestrians, hikers, joggers and bicyclists. The bridge deck stands 212 feet above the river's surface and is 6,768 feet (1.28 miles) long, making it the longest, elevated pedestrian bridge in the world.The Poughkeepsie-Highland  Railroad Bridge was built in the late 19th century to link New York and New England to an extensive, nationwide railway network.  For decades, it was a major rail corridor for both freight and passengers.After a fire in 1974, the bridge was abandoned and sat for decades as an orphaned relic.  The park was made possible due to the unwavering commitment of the community, who, through a non-profit organization called Walkway Over the Hudson, forged a public-private partnership involving the State of New York, the federal government, neighboring municipalities, private corporations and other not for profit groups.  The amazing result of this partnership is Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, one of the Hudson Valley's top attractions.Ride the glass elevator up to the park or down to the Poughkeepsie waterfront and be treated to great views of the surrounding scenery and the structure of the bridge.
